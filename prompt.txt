
Imagine there is a company that provides technical assistance to customers. Its name is Kraken Services. It has an oceanic theme. Create a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that will have 2 website pages each accessible through a dropdown menu in the top left corner of the website. The first page is an about page. This page will feature a picture in the top and several paragraphs explaining why the company was founded. It will include a mission statement. At the bottom of the about page, there will be social media links as well as an email. The seperate second website page will list all the services the company offers including desktop computer builds, laptop modifications, device inspections, and general tech support. This page will have the prices of the services as well as a picture. This page should look very professional encouraging the user to purchase a service. Each service should have a button that when clicked will add the service to the cart. The third website page will be a checkout screen. This screen will be accessible via a cart icon in the top right of the screen. When visited, this page will show all of the items that the user would like to purchase in a list format. The items will display the price as well as a picture. At the bottom of the checkout page will be a checkout button that will allow the user to pay for the items they had in the cart. On the checkout page, the items that have been added to the cart should show in a list format. At the bottom of the checkout page, there should be a button that allows the user to pay for the services in the cart. Make sure the website is visually appealing and has creative aspects to it. The website should have 3 different pages and not sections. One for about, one for services, and one for checkout.
